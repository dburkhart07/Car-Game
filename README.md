# Car-Game
Web app game simulating a red car moving left or right in a 3 lane road to avoid oncoming blue cars.
Each time a blue car passes the red car (ie: a crash did not occur), the score increases by one. This happens until there is a crash, in which a game over occurs, and the score is shown, as well as a restart button of the user wants to play again.
The speed of the blue car can be controlled, by changing how fast it moves from the game frame within the code.
Created using an HTML and CSS frontend, with a Javascript backend.
